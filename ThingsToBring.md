Things to Bring to your Hackathon
============================

One of the most important things to "bring" to a hackathon is the Internet connection. 
But this is actually one of the most difficult things to do. 
Hotel or home wifi is frequently underpowered to have 100 people downloading data at the same time. 
Networking requirements vary dramatically depending on what your subject-matter and methods are. 
So if you are doing hardware device hacking, it could be really important to have hard-wire networking. 
It might be helpful to bring your own pineapples (wifi-network spots) for a local-only network. 
Perhaps you want to coordinate people bringing a network of mobile hotspots. 

If you are doing a data hackathon, you really need to either ensure that you have an awesome-super reliable Internet Connection
so that everyone can download the same 100 GB file in the first 5 minutes of the hackathon, or you need to have local
file sharing resources, or you need to have some USB sticks. Not that USB sticks are (currently) not terribly secure, 
so lots of people will refuse to take a USB drive anymore. So having a blu-ray disk with a USB reader might be the right approach.


## For organizers
- [ ] Tables for teams to work together
- [ ] Extension cords to connect work tables to facility power
- [ ] Duct tape to tape extension cords to the floor to reduce tripping hazard.
- [ ] a power bar for each table. 
- [ ] For 10-25% of tables, also provide hard-wire networking (cat-5) (see notes on Internet Connections
- [ ] 16-port hubs for tables
- [ ] A data distribution methods (see notes)
- [ ] A collection of display dongles, so that people who have displayport, HDMI, VGA, DVI or whatever, can convert their signal to.. whatever.
- [ ] A method to handle the projection of laptop data
- [ ] A method to handle the projection of cell-phone screens (apple TV works for iphone, chromecast works for android, etc)
- [ ] HEALTHY food options. You should not be incentivitzing unhealthy habits by only providing junk food. You need to have options, for Vegans, Vegitarians, Keto, Primal, Gluten-free, 
- [ ] Also junk food. 
- [ ] You want to have a room where you can turn the lights out and not have announcements place for people to sleep if they want
- [ ] ways to share/mirror monitors between teams

## For participants
- [ ] Extra monitors
- [ ] monitor cables
- [ ] dongles for monitors
- [ ] laptop stands
- [ ] hardware for hardware hacking
- [ ] power cables for laptops
